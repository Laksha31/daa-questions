**DAA LAB QUESTIONS**

This repository contains the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) lab experiments implemented as part of the course curriculum. The aim of this repository is to provide clean, well-documented implementations of algorithmic problems using different paradigms like Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Branch & Bound, and String Matching.

**ðŸ“– Syllabus & Experiments**
**Experiment 1-4: Divide and Conquer Approach.**
1- Implement iterative and recursive Binary Search and compare performance.
2- Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort and compare performance for the same dataset.
3- Compare Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication with the traditional matrix multiplication method.

**Experiment 5-9: Greedy & Dynamic Programming Approach.**
1- Implement the Activity Selection Problem to understand the greedy approach.
2- Implement Matrix Chain Multiplication to study parenthesization effects.
3- Compare Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm for single-source shortest path problems.
4- Solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using both greedy and dynamic programming approaches.

**Experiment 10-13: Backtracking and Branch & Bound Approach.**
1- Implement Sum of Subset problem.
2- Implement the N-Queen Problem using backtracking.
3- Compare Backtracking and Branch & Bound approaches for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

**Experiment 14-15: String Matching Problems.**
1- Compare performance of the following string matching algorithms:
